# SimGlucose Environment
This code was adapted for the ICLR 2024 Paper Submission: "Preventing Reward Hacking using Occupancy Measure Regularization". More details about how to run experiments can be found within our main repository and our paper.

This repository is based on the [code](https://github.com/aypan17/reward-misspecification/tree/main/glucose) of [Pan et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03544). 

The original code release for the SimGlucose Environment (Deep Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Blood Glucose Control, MLHC 2020) can be found [here](https://github.com/MLD3/RL4BG).

## Installation
Installing the requirements from our main repository will install all required packages for this environment as well.

To install this envvironment, simply run
